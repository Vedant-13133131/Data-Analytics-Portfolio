# Data Analytics Portfolio

## Introduction
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm a passionate data analyst with a strong interest in solving complex business problems, providing data-driven insights, and making informed decisions. I'm strongly interested in roles that involve the applications of data analytics and statistical tools in Business or Finance.

I believe in the power of data to transform businesses, and I'm dedicated to leveraging my skills to drive success. In this portfolio, you'll find a collection of projects that showcase my problem-solving abilities, data analysis skills, and ability to communicate insights effectively.

I am still fairly new to the field, and intend to learn and grow more everyday. Please feel free to explore my projects and don't hesitate in reaching out for collaboration or job opportunities or just leaving feedback/criticism.
